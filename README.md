This repo contains the code for the backend of _The Vertical_'s website.
_The Vertical_ is a swiss cycling challenge consisting of cycling from Switzerland's northernmost point to Switzerland's southernmost point.  

The backend handles the storing/serving of records to be displayed on the frontend. 
It is built in Python, leveraging FastAPI for handling routes and Docker for containerization.
